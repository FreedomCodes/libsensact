== libsensact - the sensor/actuator library =====

1. Introduction

This library provides a simple API for communicating with sensors and actuators
connected via various connection types.

Currently only USB connections are supported. However, in the future a modular
communication backend will be supported so that it will be possible to
integrate with open or proprietary communication backends.

2. Example application

 #include <stdio.h>
 #include <unistd.h>
 #include "sensact.h"

 #define TIMEOUT 1000 // ms

 /* 
  * This example uses libsensact to fetch roll, pitch, and yaw values from the
  * "compass0" sensor. The sensor is connected via USB.
  */

 int main(void)
 {
    int handle;
    int roll, pitch, yaw;

    handle = connect("compass0");

    get_int(handle, "roll", &roll, TIMEOUT);
    printf("roll:     %03d\n", roll);

    get_int(handle, "pitch", &pitch, TIMEOUT);
    printf("pitch:    %03d\n", pitch);

    get_int(handle, "yaw", &yaw, TIMEOUT);
    printf("yaw:      %03d\n", yaw);

    disconnect(handle);

    return 0;
 }
